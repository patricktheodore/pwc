      "Pure water window cleaning is the modern method of cleaning windows. It combines purified water with a telescopic pole and brush. Purified water gets pushed through and up a telescoping water fed pole onto the surface. When completed the correct way the glass surface and frames dry spot free. Pure water can be used on a number of surfaces including solar panels, walls, garage doors and eliminates the need for harsh chemicals that are not environmentally friendly.",

      "We invest in the best equipment available which means the best finish for your windows. Our Ionic Quattro System is the most effective system on the market for window, solar panel and hard surface exterior cleaning applications. The system uses a number of filters to purify water to zero parts per million resulting in surfaces that are left clean and spot free. The system pushes water out of the water fed pole at high pressure allowing it to clean at increased heights and increasing efficiency.",
